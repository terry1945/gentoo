		<img src="awesomegentoo.png">
		
		<p>My Gentoo journey started a few days ago. I saw a 
		utube video about this linux distribution. Since then
		I've attemepted to install the base system four times.
		</p>
		<p>
		Two failed and two suceeded. One success was in virtmanager and the 		other was in virtualbox 6 on an old mac pro. That one I got up to
		xorg and awesome wm working.
		</p>
		<p>
		I ordered a renewed Lenovo think center to install it on. That is
		scheduled for delivery today.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'll use this in conjuction with some courses I'm doing regarding
		Linux, web development and programming.
